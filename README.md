# Machine-learning-for-safer-roads
It contains a bunch of sample codes that I have used to build models that can predict fatal accidents on the roads of Los Angeles. 
I have used Logistic Regression and Random Forest model to classify instances. The data is publicly available (LA vision zero data) online published by Los Angeles traffic department. The data is very imbalanced and hence Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) has been used. SMOTE code is not included here.
